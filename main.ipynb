Students who have taken this course have reported learning rigorous proofs behind calculus theory, covering sequences and series, continuity, and differentiability of functions. The course had quizzes, assignments, and both mid and final exams. The course instructor, Dr. Waqas, was praised for teaching effectively and providing notes on his website. If you enjoy proof-writing and want to build up your skills in rigorous mathematics, this course could be a good fit for you. It's also the basis for most advanced mathematics courses.\n",
